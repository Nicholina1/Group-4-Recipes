Emo Tuo, also known as rice balls, is a popular Ghanaian dish often enjoyed with light soup or groundnut soup. Here's a simple recipe to prepare Emo Tuo:

Ingredients:

- 2 cups of rice
- Water for soaking and cooking
- Salt to taste

Instructions:

1. Rinse and Soak:
   - Rinse the rice thoroughly under cold water to remove excess starch.
   - Place the rinsed rice in a bowl and cover it with water. Allow it to soak for at least 2 to 3 hours or overnight. This softens the rice for easier blending.

2. Blend Rice:
   - Drain the soaked rice.
   - In a blender, add the drained rice and a small amount of water (just enough to facilitate blending).
   - Blend until you achieve a smooth and thick consistency.

3. Cook Rice Batter:
   - Pour the blended rice into a pot or saucepan.
   - Add water gradually while stirring to avoid lumps.
   - Cook the mixture over medium heat, stirring continuously until it thickens into a smooth, stretchy, and elastic dough-like consistency.
   - Add salt to taste, stirring it into the mixture.

4. Shape into Balls:
   - Wet your hands with water to prevent sticking.
   - Scoop a portion of the rice mixture and shape it into a ball using both hands. Traditionally, Emo Tuo is small, round, and slightly flattened.

5. Serve:
   - Emo Tuo is typically served with light soup or groundnut soup. Enjoy it by dipping the rice ball into the soup and savoring the delicious combination.
